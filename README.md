# 4-Queens Local Search

This Python script uses a local search algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem where the goal is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.

## Queen Class

The `Queen` class is used to represent the chessboard and the placement of queens on it. It provides methods to add queens to the chessboard and get neighbors for a given queen.

## Local Search Algorithm

The `local_search` function implements a basic local search algorithm, specifically hill-climbing, to find a solution to the N-Queens problem. The algorithm starts with an initial placement of queens and iteratively moves queens to reduce conflicts until a solution is found.

## Usage

To use the script, create an instance of the `Queen` class by providing the initial queen locations in the form of a list of coordinates. Then, call the `add_queen` method to initialize the chessboard. Finally, call the `local_search` method to apply the local search algorithm and find a solution.

```python
# Example usage:
queen_locations = [[2, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1, 3]]
queen_instance = Queen(queen_locations)

print("Initial State:")
for row in queen_instance.chess_board:
    print(row)

initial_cost, _, _ = calc_cost(queen_instance.state)
hill_climbing(queen_instance, initial_cost)

print("Final State:")
for row in queen_instance.chess_board:
    print(row)
